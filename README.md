# EventHub
a decoupled pub/sub-style event message system for JavaScript

This is similar to npm packages like decouplejs, but with the ability to set the 'this' keyword in the callback function to the object you want. Because of how JavaScript sets 'this', callback functions are often set to a different object than desired.
